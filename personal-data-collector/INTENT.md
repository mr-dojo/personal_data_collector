# PDC Intent

## Why This Exists
**Data Sovereignty & AI Context Building**

Everyone else is using your data - Google, Meta, OpenAI train on your content while you get nothing back. PDC flips this: collect YOUR data, make it easily accessible, use it on YOUR terms.

## Core Philosophy: Easy In, Easy Out
Data should flow freely in both directions:
- **Easy Import**: Email, clipboard, browser - frictionless collection
- **Easy Export**: MD/TXT/JSON - instant access for AI tools or analysis
- **Simplicity**: Minimal setup, obvious workflows
- **Transparency**: Clear storage, readable formats, no black boxes

## North Star
Personal AI context engine. Collect everything you find valuable, access it instantly for AI conversations, research, and decision-making.

## Current Scope
- Email-triggered collection ("PDC:" emails â†’ automatic scraping)
- Flexible export system (MD/TXT/JSON on demand)
- Local-only storage with zero cloud dependencies
- Content deduplication to prevent noise

## Future Scope (When Needed)
- One-click browser saving
- Clipboard monitoring  
- Life domain categorization (work, family, health, etc.)
- Mobile capture workflow

## Anti-Goals
- Complex workflows (easy in, easy out)
- Enterprise features (single-user focus)
- Cloud dependencies (your data, your hardware)
- Hidden processes (transparency always)
